I'm releasing all the PSD's for what I've made (will be updated accordingly) or modifed so it can be manipulated per desire.
Note that some of the assets is based on other people's work..
 
I generally cannot grant any license or give any permissions on what I didn't do and only re-used. 
Note that all the stuff used is from public domain (obtained by web where released or re-used from the project) 
and not based on property license, at least not directly - I can't say where others got it..

So in any case, what I did made is released and can be used freely and has no license so you can freely use it as you want
in any way you want. Credit would be nice but not required. ;)  

NOTE:
=============================================== 

I've tried to avoid using any custom brushes or other add-ons besides ones that are vital, 
so anyone can pick it up without to much hassle. 

Be aware that this was made with photoshop CS4 so may be incompatible with previous versions, but I think
it should work fine at least on CS3 (not sure really).

NOTE 2:
===============================================

All the addons (font(s) and maybe brushes later on) are released under various GPL licenses and are not made by me
so I don't claim any credits. Sadly stuff is been laying on my hard drive for years now for internal use
so all the links of original authors and license notes have been lost...If anyone has a link of them 
let me know and I'll gladly include them in!

That's about it.

Cheers
